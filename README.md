## About :

Form Document classifier - using Machine learning / Deep learning

## Problem Statement:
To build a predictive model for classifying a scanned Form document into one of multiple form types (eg: Form X, Form D), if the document isn’t a form, then a category called “Other”

## Libraries:

Libraries used :  
                  ```
                  Core libraries: numpy,sklearn,pandas,matplotlib
                  ```
                  <br />
                   ```
                  Machine Learning / NLP Libraries  : Sci-kit Learn(sk-learn), NLTK
                  ```
                  <br />
                  ```
                  Deep Learning Libraries : Tensorflow, Keras
                  ```
## Embeddings : 
Fasttext pre-trained (english) word vectors were also used as embeddings: https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html


## Flow:- 
1. Data cleaning
2. Data pre-processing
3. Feature Selection
4. Stopwords removal 
5. Feature Encoding
6. Creating Bag-of-words(BoW) model 
7. Final Model creation

## Selection of model 

Since the dataset consists of categorical data, classification algorithms were used to strengthen the predictive power of the model.

Here two models were built viz: 

1. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **SGD classifier**
4. **Logistic Regression**


## Result:
To determine the best model to use for this classification problem, a comparison was done between all of the models.

The final result - **LSTM** model wins in the deep learning category for this task!   

1) Machine Learning: **SGD classifier** performed slightly better as compared to all  the other models in terms of accuracy.

2) Deep Learning:  **LSTM Architecture** provided the best results for predicting overall emotion from text, even better than SGD
